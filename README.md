portfolio website for Anthony Allgood

By Martin Allgood

This was a portfolio website built for my Dad who is an actor. It was built using Vue.js in the front and Node.js in the back.

To allow for better control of data when the webite is published, the image galleries will be controlled by an imgur account and then the data is grabbed from that account via axios requests and also a backend to store working credits that the user will be able to log in to update and edit.
